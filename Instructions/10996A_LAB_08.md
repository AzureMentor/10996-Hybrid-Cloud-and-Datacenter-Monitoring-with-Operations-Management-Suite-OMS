1. Install the OMS agent

2. Create Contoso's business-critical file to track

3. Configure OMS to track changes to the file

4. Create the Contoso's business-critical registry key to track

5. Configure OMS to track changes to the registry key

6. Modify the file tracked by OMS

7. Review the file change detection in OMS

8. Modify the registry key tracked by OMS

9. Review the registry key change detection in OMS

detected change in the Change Tracking dashboard.

### Exercise 2: Configure the Update Management Solution Pack

Scenario

Contoso already has Update Management configured in OMS for their
business-critical files and application servers. They need to use a separate
update schedule for their domain controllers as the maintenance window for
updates in different to the file and application servers. To facilitate this,
you must create a computer group that contains only Contoso’s domain
controllers. You must then create an Update Deployment in OMS using the domain
controllers computer group.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a computer group for Contoso's domain controllers

2. Create an update deployment for Contoso's domain controllers

3. Confirm the update deployment has succeeded

####   Task 1: Create a computer group for Contoso's domain controllers

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value          |
|----------|----------------|
| Computer | **LON-HOST1**  |
| Tool     | **OMS Portal** |
| Location | **Desktop**    |

1.  From the desktop, open the **OMS Portal**

2.  Open the **Log Search** blade and submit the following query:

Computer = ‘LON-DC\*’ \| Distinct Computer

1.  Confirm **LON-DC1** is listed in the results

2.  Use the **Save** button to save the query with the following settings:

    -   Name: **Domain Controllers**

    -   Category: **Contoso**

    -   Save this query as a computer group: **Yes**

3.  From the **Settings** page, open **Computer Groups**

4.  From the **Saved Groups** tab confirm the **CONTOSO:Domain Controllers**
    Computer Group is listed

5.  Open the **View Group Members** query for the Computer Group and confirm
    **LON-DC1.contoso.com** is listed in the results

6.  Go back to the **Operations Management Suite** home page

7.  Leave the **OMS Portal** open

####   Task 2: Create an update deployment for Contoso's domain controllers

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value          |
|----------|----------------|
| Computer | **LON-HOST1**  |
| Tool     | **OMS Portal** |
| Location | **Desktop**    |

1.  In the **OMS Portal**, open the **Update Management** dashboard

2.  From the **Manage Update Deployments** tile, create a new **Update
    Deployment** with the following settings, all other settings should remain
    as default:

    -   Name: **All Domain Controllers**

    -   Computers: **CONTOSO:Domain Controllers**

    -   Schedule\\Time Zone: **Select your time zone**

    -   Schedule\\Schedule Type: **One Time**

    -   Start Time: **Leave as default but make a note of the time shown**

    -   Duration: **60 minutes**

3.  Save the **Update Deployment**

4.  From the **Scheduled** tab, confirm the **CONTOSO:All Domain Controllers**
    Update Deployment is listed

5.  Note the time displayed in the **Start time** column

6.  Leave the **OMS Portal** open on the **Update Deployments** page

####   Task 3: Confirm the update deployment has succeeded

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value          |
|----------|----------------|
| Computer | **LON-HOST1**  |
| Tool     | **OMS Portal** |
| Location | **Desktop**    |

1.  In the **OMS Portal**, from the **Update Deployments** page, open the
    **Running** tab

2.  Wait until the **All Domain Controllers** Update Deployment is displayed

3.  Open **Hyper-V Manager** and wait until the **LON-DC1** virtual machine is
    automatically restarted

4.  Open the **Completed** tab in the **OMS Portal** and wait until the A**ll
    Domain Controllers** Update Deployment appears. This confirms the **Update
    Deployment** successfully completed

5.  Close the **OMS Portal**

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have created a computer
group in OMS for Contoso’s domain controllers. You should have then created an
Update Deployment that uses the computer group to target updates only to
Contoso’s domain controllers. Finally, you should have confirmed that the Update
Deployment has successfully applied updates to Contoso’s domain controllers.

>   **Question:** You have configured Change Tracking in OMS to detect changes
>   to the Windows Registry. After making a change to the registry on one of the
>   managed computers in OMS, you notice that the change is not reflected in the
>   Change Tracking dashboard. After 30 minutes, the change is still not
>   reflected in the dashboard. What could be the problem?
