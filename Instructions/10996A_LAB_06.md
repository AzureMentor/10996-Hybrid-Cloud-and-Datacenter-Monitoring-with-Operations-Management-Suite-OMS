### Exercise 1: Operating OMS Log Analytics

Scenario

You need to confirm that OMS is collecting data from both the datacenter and
cloud environment. You must use the built-in Log Analytics queries and
PowerShell to facilitate this.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Operate OMS Log Search using a built-in query

2. Operate OMS Log Search using a custom query

3. Query Log Analytics using PowerShell

####   Task 1: Operate OMS Log Search using a built-in query

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value          |
|----------|----------------|
| Computer | **LON-HOST1**  |
| Tool     | **OMS Portal** |
| Location | **Desktop**    |

1.  Open the **OMS Portal** and login using your credentials

2.  Open the **Log Search** blade and then run the **All data collected grouped
    by 1HOUR interval** built-in query

3.  Review the visualization of data collected, which shows peak times, or when
    the platform is not running.

4.  Return to the home page of the **OMS Portal**.

####   Task 2: Operate OMS Log Search using a custom query

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value          |
|----------|----------------|
| Computer | **LON-HOST1**  |
| Tool     | **OMS Portal** |
| Location | **Desktop**    |

1.  Open the **OMS Portal** and login using your credentials

2.  Open the **Log Search** blade and then run the following query:

\* (Computer="LON-DC1.contoso.com")

1.  Review the information returned from the query including:

    -   Computer

    -   OSType

    -   ComputerIP

2.  Return to the home page of the **OMS Portal**.

3.  In the top-right hand side of the **OMS Portal,** make a note of the **OMS
    Workspace** name

####   Task 3: Query Log Analytics using PowerShell

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value                  |
|----------|------------------------|
| Computer | **LON-HOST1**          |

    **Cmdlet**:

>   Find-Module AzureRM.OperationalInsights \| Install-Module

Import-Module AzureRM.OperationalInsights

1.  Accept the **NuGet** prompt, then run the following **Cmdlet**:

>   Find-Module AzureRM.Resources \| Install-Module

Import-Module AzureRM.Resources

1.  Accept the **NuGet** prompt, then run the following **Cmdlet**:

Login-AzureRmAccount

1.  Sign into the **OMS Workspace** using your credentials

2.  Set the **Resource Group** and **Workspace Name** parameters by running the
    following **PowerShell** commands:

\$ResourceGroupName = "mms-wcus"

\$WorkSpaceName = "YourWorkSpaceNAme"

1.  In the command above, replace **YourWorkSpaceName** with the **OMS
    Workspace** name that you noted from the previous task.

2.  Run the following **Cmdlets** to query **Log Analytics**

\$Result = Get-AzureRmOperationalInsightsSearchResults -ResourceGroupName
\$ResourceGroupName -WorkspaceName \$WorkSpaceName -Query \*

\$result.Value \| ConvertFrom-Json

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used the Log Search blade in
OMS to run queries that return data collected in OMS. They should have also used
PowerShell to retrieve filtered data.

### Exercise 2: Creating custom visualizations in OMS

Scenario

You need to create a custom view and dashboard in OMS that operators can use to
review events being collected on Contoso’s domain controllers. To facilitate
this, you must use the View Designer in OMS.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a new dashboard in OMS

2. Create a custom view in OMS

####   Task 1: Create a new dashboard in OMS

2.  From the **Change Tracking** section, add the **All Windows Services
    Changes** tile to the dashboard

3.  From the **General Exploration** section, add the **All computers with their
    most recent data** tile to the dashboard

4.  Return to the home page of the **OMS Portal a**nd then re-open **My
    Dashboard**

5.  Open the **All Windows Services Changes** tile and review the information
    returned

6.  Open the **All computers with their most recent data** tile and review the
    information returned

7.  Return to the home page of the **OMS Portal**

| Location | **Desktop**    |

1.  In the **OMS Portal** on **LON-HOST1** open the **View Designer** tile

2.  Add the **18 Number** Gallery item to the view and configure the properties
    as follows:

3.  Name: **Events collected on LON-DC1**

4.  Legend: **Total Number of Events**

5.  Query: **\* Computer = "LON-DC1.contoso.com"** Add the **Number and List**
    item into the **View Dashboard** tab and configure the properties as
    follows:

    -   Legend: **Total Events**

    -   Title Query: **\* Computer = "LON-DC1.contoso.com"**

    -   List Query: **\* Computer = "LON-DC1.contoso.com" \| measure count() by
        Type**

6.  Save the view and then open and review the information provided in the view

7.  Return to the home page of the **OMS Portal**

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used the View Designer in OMS
to create a custom dashboard that shows the events being generated on Contoso
domain controllers.

### Exercise 3: Log search, alerts and Power BI

Scenario

You need to use the OMS Log Search feature to view data collected by Log
Analytics. Additionally, you must configure Alerting such that an alert is
generated when computers with missing critical or security updates have been
detected by OMS. Finally, you must integrate Log Search with Power BI to
generate visualizations of the Contoso data collected in OMS.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Using the built-in queries

2. Using Computer Groups

3. Configuring Alerting

1.  Open the **Log Search** blade in the **OMS Porta**l on **LON-HOST1** and
    then run the **All computers with missing critical or security updates**
    built-in query

2.  Use the **Alerts** button to create a new **Alert Rule** with the following
    settings, all other settings should remain as default:

    -   Rule name: **Computers with missing critical or security updates**

    -   Number of results: **1**

    -   Recipients: **Confirm a valid email address has been provided**

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location | Value          |
|----------|----------------|
| Computer | **LON-HOST1**  |
| Tool     | **OMS Portal** |
| Location | **Desktop**    |

1.  Open the **Settings** blade in the **OMS Portal** and then from the
    **Preview Features** tab, enable **PowerBI** integration

2.  From the **Accounts** tab use the **Connect to PowerBI** setting to connect
    to the PowerBI Portal using your **Microsoft Account**

![](media/6d654d37fc3b91e5a5db729bec505e80.png)

>   **Note:** Note that the account you use for the previous step must be
>   associated with an organizational account such as those used in Office 365.

1.  Open the **Log Search** blade and then run the following query:

>   \* Type=Alert \| Distinct AlertName

1.  Use the **PowerBI** button to save the results to **PowerBI** using a
    **Name** and **Datasets Name** of **All Alerts in the past 24 Hours**,
    change the **Schedule** to **15 Minutes**

2.  Wait for 5 minutes

3.  Browse to the **PowerBI P**ortal at
    **https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/landing/signin/** and login using your
    **Microsoft Account**

4.  Open the **All Alerts in the past 24 Hours** dataset and then create a new
    report named **All Alerts in the past 24 Hours** using the **Pie Chart**
    visualization and select the following fields:

    -   Count

    -   Alert name

5.  Save and then open the report and review the information provided

6.  Close the **Power BI** portal

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used the Log Search facility
in OMS to retrieve data collected by Log Analytics. You should have also
configured an Alert Rule that generates an alert when missing critical or
security updates have been detected on Contoso computers. Finally, you should
have also configured integration between Log Search and Power BI to create
visualizations of Contoso data collected in OMS.
