    -   LON-SQ1

    -   LON-AP1

3.  Return to the **OMS Porta**l home page

4.  Leave the **OMS Portal** open

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have created a network for each of
Contoso’s application monitoring requirements and added the relevant subnetwork
to each network. You should have also enabled monitoring for each node detected
in the Network Performance Monitor dashboard.

### Exercise 3: Configuring Network Performance Monitor Rules

Scenario

Now that you have configured the relevant networks, subnetworks, and monitoring
nodes in the Network Performance Monitor solution, you must configure the
network monitoring rules to monitor the performance of the network. This
includes the finance and human resources (HR) subnetworks and their links to the
corporate network. The finance network is a highly-secure network and other than
finance applications, only ICMP traffic is allowed to pass through it. You
should configure thresholds for both latency and packet loss for each network.
Contoso also requires that when threshold breaches occur, an email notification
should be sent to NetAdmin\@Contoso.com.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create a network monitoring rule for the HR application

2. Create a network monitoring rule for the Finance application

3. Configure alert rules for the Finance and HR applications
