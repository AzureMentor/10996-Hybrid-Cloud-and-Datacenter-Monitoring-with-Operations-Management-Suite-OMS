Module 15: Operating Operations Management Suite Protection and Recovery

Lab: Operating the environment for the Protection and Recovery Solution Pack
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario

After preparing the environment for the disaster recovery plan of Contoso Ltd.,
you must test that you can protect and recover critical data by using Azure
Backup Server. This includes SQL Server databases and file data from Contoso’s
file server. To facilitate this, you must use the Azure Backup Server UI that
was installed and configured in the previous lab. You must also configure the
replication of Contoso’s virtual machine environment in Azure Site Recovery and
then configure a recovery plan that will be used to failover virtual machines
from the on-premises environment to Azure.

Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Protect and recover data by using Azure Backup Server.

-   Use Azure Site Recovery to replicate on-premises virtual machines and test a
    failover to Azure.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **80 minutes**

**LON-HOST1 Virtual Machines:** LON-DC1, LON-AP1, LON-SQ1, LON-SQ2, LON-VM2,
LON-HYP2

**User Name:** Contoso\\Administrator

**Password**: Pa55w.rd

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Protect and recover data using Azure Backup Server.

-   Use Azure Site Recovery to replicate on-premises virtual machines and test a
    failover to Azure.

###  Exercise 1: Protect and Recover Data in Azure Backup Server

Scenario

As mentioned in the lab in Module 14 “*Configuring Operations Management Suite
Protection and Recovery*”, Contoso has a number of business-critical files and
folders that require protection. Contoso also uses several SQL Server databases
that hold critical data for its applications and customers. You must ensure that
the files, folders, and SQL Server databases are adequately protected from loss
or corruption. To facilitate this, you must use the Azure Backup Server that was
installed as part of the lab in Module 14. You must also use Azure Backup Server
to test the recovery of these files and SQL Server databases to confirm that the
backup solution operates as expected.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure the Storage Pool and install Protection Agents in Azure Backup
Server

2. Create a Protection Group for file data in Azure Backup Server

3. Create a Protection Group for SQL Server data in Azure Backup Server

4. Confirm data is backed up in Azure

5. Configure Recovery Settings in Azure Backup Server

6. Recover file data from Azure using Azure Backup Server

7. Recover SQL Server data from Azure using Azure Backup Server

Server to recover file and folder data and SQL Server databases from Azure.

### Exercise 2: Replicate on-premises virtual machines to Azure using Azure Site Recovery

Scenario

You need to ensure that the virtualized workloads in Contoso can continue to run
even in the event of a disaster. To facilitate this, you must use Azure Site
Recovery to replicate the on-premises virtual machines managed by Hyper-V and
System Center VMM to Azure by using Azure Site Recovery. You must then create a
recovery plan that will be used to fail over the virtualized workloads to Azure
should a disaster recovery scenario arise.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Enable replication for on-premises virtual machines to Azure in using Azure
Site Recovery

2. Confirm replication is running

3. Create a Recovery Plan

|-----------------|-------------------|
| Computer        | **LON-HOST1**     |
| Tool            | **Azure Portal**  |
| Location        | **Desktop**       |
| Navigation Link | **More Services** |

1.  Open the **ContosoRecoveryVault**

2.  Under the **Monitoring And Reports** section, open **Site Recovery Jobs**
    and review the following information including:

    -   Vault

    -   Protected Item

    -   Source

    -   Target

3.  Close the **Site Recovery Jobs** page and then under the **Protected Items**
    section, open the **Replicated Items** page

4.  Confirm the **CONTOSO-WL01** virtual machine is displayed

5.  Close the **Replicated Items** page

####   Task 3: Create a Recovery Plan

To perform this task, use the computer and tool information in the following
table.

| Location        | Value             |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Computer        | **LON-HOST1**     |
| Tool            | **Azure Portal**  |
| Location        | **Desktop**       |
| Navigation Link | **More Services** |

1.  Open the **ContosoRecoveryVault** and then under the **Getting Started**
    section, open **Site Recovery**

2.  From the **Step 2: Manage Recovery Plans** section use the **+ Recovery
    plan**. option to create a new **Recovery Plan** with the following
    settings:

    -   Name. **ContosoWorkloadDR**

    -   Source. **On-Premises VMM Server (LON-VM2)**

    -   Target: **Microsoft Azure**

    -   Allow items with deployment model: **Resource Manager**

    -   Select Items: **CONTOSO-WL01**

3.  Open the **Recovery Plan** and from the **Settings** page review the
    following:

    -   Items in recovery plan

    -   Compute and Network

    -   Disks

4.  Note that until the initial replication of **CONTO-WL01** has completed, no
    information is displayed in the **Settings** pane as described above. It is
    recommended to return to this step after completing the next lab by which
    time, replication would have completed.

5.  From the **Customize** section review the **Group** information available

6.  Close the Azure Portal

![](media/6d654d37fc3b91e5a5db729bec505e80.png)

>   **Note:** Some of the options available in the Recovery Plan including
>   Failover and Planned Failover are not available while the initial
>   replication is in progress. Also note that the replication will take some
>   time to complete. It is not expected for students to wait for this. In
>   addition, if the replication of CONTOSO-WL01 has failed, information such as
>   the Compute and Network sections are not available.

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used Azure Site Recovery to
enable replication for virtualized environment in Contoso to Azure. You should
have then confirmed that the workloads are replicating to Azure. Finally, you
should have created a recovery plan that will be used to failover the workloads
in Contoso to Azure should a disaster occur with the on-premises site.
