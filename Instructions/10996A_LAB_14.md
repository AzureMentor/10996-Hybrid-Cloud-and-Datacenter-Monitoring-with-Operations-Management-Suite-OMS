Module 14: Configuring Operations Management Suite Protection and Recovery

Lab: Configuring the environment for the Protection and Recovery Solution Pack
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario

Contoso Ltd. has several business-critical applications running on various
physical and virtual machines in their datacenter. They also store many critical
files, databases, and various web sites locally on computers in the datacenter.
Currently, there is no backup or disaster recovery procedure for virtual
machines and locally stored data. You have been asked to provide a backup
solution for the workloads running on virtual machines and data stored in the
datacenter. You have also been tasked with creating and testing a disaster
recovery solution for the business-critical workloads running on virtual
machines in the datacenter. All virtual machines are hosted locally on Hyper-V
that is also being managed with System Center VMM. To facilitate the backup and
disaster recovery requirements for Contoso, you must first prepare the
environment.

Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Preparing the environment for backups in OMS Backup to protect Contoso’s
    workloads and file data.

-   Preparing the environment for disaster recovery in Azure Site Recovery for
    Contoso’s virtualized workloads.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **120 minutes**

**LON-HOST1 Virtual Machines:** LON-DC1, LON-AP1, LON-HYP2, LON-SQ2, LON-VM2

**User Name:** Contoso\\Administrator

**Password**: Pa55w.rd

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Preparing the environment for backups in OMS Backup to protect Contoso’s
    workloads and file data.

-   Preparing the environment for disaster recovery in Azure Site Recovery for
    Contoso’s virtualized workloads.

### Exercise 1: Configure OMS Backup

Scenario

Contoso utilizes many Microsoft applications in its datacenter as part of its
day-to-day business. Contoso also stores business-critical files on virtual
machines located in the datacenter. You need to ensure these workloads and the
associated file data is backed up on a regular schedule. You also need to ensure
that, if required, items such as SQL Server databases and end-user files, can be
recovered in the event of accidental loss or corruption. To facilitate this, you
must prepare the infrastructure for OMS Backup.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Confirm location availability

2. Create a Recovery Services Vault for Backup

3. Configure Backup in the Azure Portal

4. Install Azure Backup Server

5. Confirm the Azure Backup Server is registered in Azure

>   **Note:** Due to possible restrictions with Azure Pass and locations in
>   which Azure virtual machines can be created, this task is provided in order
>   to determine which locations are available for students to create virtual
>   machines in the location where they are running the labs for this course. It
>   is important that students know which locations are available to them as
>   this will affect the protection and recovery tasks performed in this lab and
>   lab 15.

downloaded the Azure Backup Server and prepared the environment for protection
in Contoso’s datacenter for SQL Server and file data.

### Exercise 2: Configuring Azure Site Recovery

Scenario

Contoso uses System Center VMM to manage its virtualized environment and has
several workloads running on Hyper-V hosted virtual machines. Currently, there
is no disaster recovery plan in place should any of the workloads fail.

3.  Save the settings and then close the **Azure Portal**

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used the Azure Portal to
create a Recovery Service vault that will be used to store recovery data for
Contoso. You should have then created a storage account that will be used with
Site Recovery. You should have then created an Azure Virtual Network that will
be used to connect Contoso’s virtual machines during a failover. You should have
then used the Azure Portal to prepare the infrastructure for disaster recovery.
This includes installing the Azure Site Recovery Provider and registering the
on-premises System Center Virtual Machine Manager Server with the Recovery
Services vault in Azure. You should have then configured the VMM Server and
relevant VMM clouds for disaster recovery. Finally, you should have configured
network mapping between the on-premises VMM virtual machine network and the
Azure Virtual Network.

>   **Question:** When configuring replication between on-premises Hyper-V
>   virtual machines managed by System Center VMM and Azure, which components do
>   you need to install on the Hyper-V servers and the VMM Server?
