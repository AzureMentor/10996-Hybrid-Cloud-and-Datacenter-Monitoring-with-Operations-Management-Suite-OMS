>   **Note:** Due to possible restrictions with Azure Pass and locations in
>   which Azure virtual machines can be created, this task is provided in order
>   to determine which locations are available for students to create virtual
>   machines in the location where they are running the labs for this course. It
>   is important that students know which locations are available to them as
>   this will affect the protection and recovery tasks performed in this lab and
>   lab 15.

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have used the Azure Portal to
create a Recovery Service vault that will be used to store recovery data for
Contoso. You should have then created a storage account that will be used with
Site Recovery. You should have then created an Azure Virtual Network that will
be used to connect Contoso’s virtual machines during a failover. You should have
then used the Azure Portal to prepare the infrastructure for disaster recovery.
This includes installing the Azure Site Recovery Provider and registering the
on-premises System Center Virtual Machine Manager Server with the Recovery
Services vault in Azure. You should have then configured the VMM Server and
relevant VMM clouds for disaster recovery. Finally, you should have configured
network mapping between the on-premises VMM virtual machine network and the
Azure Virtual Network.
